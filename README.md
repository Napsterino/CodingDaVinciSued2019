# CodingDaVinciSued2019

Cards and Dragons
Game for the 2019 Coding Da Vinci Sued Hackathon

To open the project files we recommend Unity version 2018.3.x.

You can find the builded version in the "build" folder named "CardsAndDragons.exe"
To start a game one person has to host a game and two others can join via IP.
If you want to play on a single PC you can start the game 3 times and join on localhost.

Also the Game Design Document can be found in the "docs" folder.
